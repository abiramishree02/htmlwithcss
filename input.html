    <h1 class="hen">Life Cycle of a Chicken</h1> 

    <br>
    <b>The Egg -<span style="color:blue">stage 1</span></b>  
    <p>n chickens, the process of egg laying occurs during the long stretches of summer months. A female hen after ovulation takes around 23 to 26 hours to lay the eggs. Another ovulation occurs in hens, one hour after the first set of eggs were laid.     
    </p>
    <b>The Chick -<span style="color:blue">stage 2</span></b>
    <p>By week 3 or 4 the chicks start to grow bigger and develop proper feathers. By week 8, the chicks are large enough to go outside and change their food items. From pecking on grains, they are able to peck on mealworms, scrambled eggs etc.
    </p>
    <b>The Pullet -<span style="color:blue"> (Adolescent) Stage 3</span></b>
    <p>Adult chickens moult annually where they shed old feathers and grow new feathers. After one year of monotonous egg- laying, the chicken gets exhausted and the chickens start laying eggs irregularly.
    </p>
    <b>The Adult - <span style="color:blue">Stage 4</span></b>
    <p>A pullet is two-thirds the size of an adult chicken and can get bullied during the pecking order. An adolescent female chicken might lay eggs after 18 weeks and the eggs she lays are comparatively smaller than adult eggs.
